# system-log-capture
A means to pull any possible meaningful logs, so engendering may look over for debug, troubleshooting, and analysis.

## TODO

- [ ] Add "Capture System Logs" button in the GUI
  - [ ] Function: Produce a logs in a zipped folder with
  naming convention YYYYMMDDTHHMM-captured-system-logs
  - [ ] All logs should be saved as JSON, so we can possibly
  produce a browser dashboard to view pulled logs
