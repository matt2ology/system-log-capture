## TODO

- [ ] Add "Capture System Logs" button in the GUI
  - [ ] Function: Produce a logs in a zipped folder with
        naming convention YYYYMMDDTHHMM-captured-system-logs
  - [ ] All logs should be saved as JSON, so we can possibly
        produce a browser dashboard to view pulled logs
- [ ] Add a "Reset to default output directory" button
